Generate a commit message for these changes:

# Changes (diff):
```diff
{{.Diff}}
```

# Files changed:
{{.ChangedFiles}}

# Recent commit messages for context:
{{.RecentCommits}}

Write a clear and concise commit message following conventional commit format (type(scope): description). Focus on the "what" and "why" of the changes, not just the "how".
